# Coffee & Mood & Fidelity
This project is targeted at people who frequently visit coffee shops and enjoy music enthusiastically. 

It lets you discover the coffee shops near you that only play the songs you will like. 

As a side effect, it will also enable coffee shops to play songs that will increase the number of their visitors.

The projects used to be separated into four different repositories and three services. Merged into a monorepo for convenience before making it public.
