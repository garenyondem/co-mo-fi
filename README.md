# Coffee & Mood & Fidelity
This project is targeted at people who frequently visit coffee shops and enjoy music enthusiastically. As a side effect, it will also enable coffee shops to play songs that will increase the number of their visitors.

The projects used to be separated into four different repositories and three services. Merged into a monorepo for convenience before making it public.
